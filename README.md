# ENCE360 Multipart HTTP 1.0 Downloader


This was for ENCE360 2019. Invoke with ./downloader url text file num threads directory


Final grade: A
(87.5% UC grade) 
I'll add some feedback when it is available


There is a slight bug with downloading from hqwalls.com. It is reproducable on some machines but not all, this contributes to the overall grade. 

Also there are some formatting issues and a little unused code that contributes to code
  
                                                              
The python script runtime_csv_gen.py is a really simple utility to write the time taken for each call to a specified CSV. You must simply duplicate the body of the code for each trial and write into the fields for each trial. Trial num, threads, and files are all specifiable. It's very rudimentary, but it works!
